Hospital-Patiant (Xamarin.Forms )
=============

**WARNING: requires a hack. not recommended unless the consequences are understood.**


* For the default resources **AppResources.resx** file - which *normally* would have the `AppResources.designer.cs` file auto-generated - you must manually keep the C# properties synchronized with whatever string elements you add to the resources XML. **This is going to be incredibly tedious and error prone, so using RESX localiztion with Shared Projects is not typically recommended unless you understand these limitations!**


**WARNING:** the WinPhone project has not yet been completed.
